## Motivation

The further the viewer can see, the more there is to draw.

If a shape is distant:

- The shape is smaller
- The viewer can't see as much detail
- So ... draw it with less detail

Varying detail with distance reduces upfront download time, and increases drawing speed.

## Creating multiple shape versions

To control detail, model the same shape several times:

- high detail for when the viewer is close up
- medium detail for when the viewer is nearish
- low detail for when the viewer is distant

Usually, two or three different versions is enough, but you can have as many as you want.

## Controlling level of detail

Group the shape versions as levels in an [LOD](/x_ite/components/navigation/lod) grouping node:

- LOD is short for Level of Detail
- List them from highest to lowest detail

## Syntax: LOD

An [LOD](/x_ite/components/navigation/lod) grouping node creates a group of shapes describing different levels (versions) of the same shape:

- *center* - the center of the shape
- *range* - a list of level switch ranges
- *children* - a list of shape levels

### XML Encoding

```xml
<LOD
    center='0.0 0.0 0.0'
    range='...'>
  <!-- children ... -->
</LOD>
```

### Classic Encoding

```js
LOD {
  center 0.0 0.0 0.0
  range [ ... ]
  children [ ... ]
}
```

## Choosing detail ranges

Use a list of ranges for level switch points:

- If you have 3 levels, you need 2 ranges
- Ranges are hints to the browser

**range \[ 5.0, 10.0 \]**

## Optimizing a shape

Suggested procedure to make different levels (versions):

- Make the high detail shape first
- Copy it to make a medium detail level
- Move the medium detail shape to a desired switch distance
- Delete parts that aren't dominant
- Repeat for a low detail level

Lower detail levels should use simpler geometry, fewer textures, and no text.

## A sample LOD

### XML Encoding

```xml
<LOD
    center='0.0 0.0 0.0'
    range='7.0, 10.0'>
  <Inline
      url='"torch1.x3d"'/>
  <Inline
      url='"torch2.x3d"'/>
  <Inline
      url='"torch3.x3d"'/>
</LOD>
```

### Classic Encoding

```js
LOD {
  center 0.0 0.0 0.0
  range [ 7.0, 10.0 ]
  children [
    Inline { url "torch1.x3dv" }
    Inline { url "torch2.x3dv" }
    Inline { url "torch3.x3dv" }
  ]
}
```

## Summary

Increase performance by making multiple levels of shapes:

- High detail for close up viewing
- Lower detail for more distant viewing

Group the levels in an [LOD](/x_ite/components/navigation/lod) node:

- Ordered from high detail to low detail
- Ranges to select switching distances
