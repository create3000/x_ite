## Browser Object

This section lists the methods available in the *browser* object, which allows scripts to get and set browser information.

### Instance Creation Method(s)

None. This object cannot be instantiated by the user. One global instance of the object is available. The name of the instance is Browser.

### Properties

#### **name**: string

A browser-implementation specific string describing the browser. This property is read only.

#### **version**: string

A browser-implementation specific string describing the browser version. This property is read only.

#### **providerURL**: string

If provided, the URL to the entity that wrote this browser. This property is read only.

#### **currentSpeed**: number

The current speed of the avatar in m/s. This property is read only.

#### **currentFrameRate**: number

The current frame rate in frames per second. This property is read only.

#### **description**: string
{: .writable }

A user-defined String which can be read and written.

#### **supportedProfiles**: ProfileInfoArray

Returns the list of all profiles that are supported by this browser. This property is read only.

#### **supportedComponents**: ComponentInfoArray

Returns a list of all components that are supported by this browser. This property is read only.

#### **concreteNodes**: ConcreteNodesArray

Returns a list of all concrete node classes that are supported by this browser. This property is read only.

#### **abstractNodes**: AbstractNodesArray

Returns a list of all abstract node classes that are supported by this browser. This property is read only.

#### **baseURL**: string
{: .writable }

A String value which can be read and written, containing the URL against which relative URLs are resolved. By default, this is the address of the web page itself. Although this feature is rarely needed, it can be useful when loading a `data:` or `blob:` URL with `Browser.loadURL`, or when using `Browser.createX3DFromString`. The value of *baseURL* will only be used with the external browser.

#### **currentScene**: X3DScene | X3DExecutionContext

The real type of this class is dependent on whether the user code is inside a prototype instance or not. If the user code is inside a prototype instance the property represent an X3DExecutionContext otherwise it represent an X3DScene. This property is read only.

#### **activeLayer**: SFNode | null

Returns the active layer, if any. The active layer is the layer on which navigation takes place. This property is read only.

#### **activeNavigationInfo**: SFNode | null

Returns the bound NavigationInfo node in the active layer, if any. This property is read only.

#### **activeViewpoint**: SFNode | null

Returns the bound X3DViewpointNode in the active layer, if any. This property is read only.

#### **contextMenu**: ContextMenu

Returns a reference to the corresponding ContextMenu. This property is read only.

#### **element**: X3DCanvasElement

Returns a reference to the corresponding X3DCanvasElement. This property is read only.

### Methods

#### **getSupportedProfile** (*name: string*): ProfileInfo

The `getSupportedProfile` service returns a ProfileInfo object of the named profile from the `supportedProfiles` array. The parameter is the name of a profile from which to fetch the declaration. The browser only returns a ProfileInfo object if it supports the named profile. If it does not support the named profile, an error is thrown.

#### **getSupportedComponent** (*name: string*): ComponentInfo

The `getSupportedComponent` service returns a ComponentInfo object of the named component from the `supportedComponents` array. The parameter is the name of a component from which to fetch the declaration. The browser only returns a ComponentInfo object if it supports the named component. If it does not support the component, an error is thrown.

* [List of supported components](/x_ite/components/overview/)

#### **getProfile** (*name: string*): ProfileInfo

The `getProfile` service returns a ProfileInfo object of the named profile. The parameter is the name of a profile from which to fetch the declaration. The browser only returns a ProfileInfo object if it supports the named profile. If it does not support the named profile, an error is thrown.

* [List of supported profiles](/x_ite/profiles/overview/)

#### **getComponent** (*name: string, level?: number*): ComponentInfo

The `getComponent` service returns a ComponentInfo object of the named component. The first parameter is the name of a component and the second the level from which to fetch the declaration. The browser only return a ComponentInfo object if it supports the named component and the requested level. If it does not support the component at the level desired, an error is thrown. If level is omitted, it defaults to the highest supported level of this component.

* [List of supported components](/x_ite/components/overview/)

#### **createScene** (*profile: ProfileInfo, ... components: ComponentInfo []*): Promise\<X3DScene\>

The `createScene` service creates a new empty scene that conforms to the given profile and component declarations. The Promise resolves when all components are loaded.

```js
const profile    = browser .getProfile ("Interactive");
const components = [browser .getComponent ("..."), browser .getComponent ("...")];
const scene      = await browser .createScene (profile, ... components);
```

<!--
#### **loadComponents** (*... args: Array \<X3DScene | ProfileInfo | ComponentInfoArray | ComponentInfo | string\>*): Promise\<void\> <small class="blue">non-standard</small>

Loads all components, external and internal, specified by `args`. If the argument is a `string`, the name of a component must be given.
-->

#### **replaceWorld** (*scene: X3DScene*): Promise\<void\>

Replace the current world with this new scene that has been loaded or constructed from somewhere. A Promise is returned that will be resolved when the scene is completely loaded.

#### **createX3DFromString** (*x3dSyntax: string*): Promise\<X3DScene\>

The string may be any valid X3D content in any language supported by the browser implementation. If the browser does not support the content encoding the appropriate exception will be thrown.

#### **createX3DFromURL** (*url: MFString, node: SFNode, event: string*): void

Parse the passed URL into an X3D scene. When complete send the passed event to the passed node. The event is a string with the name of an MFNode inputOnly field of the passed node.

#### **createX3DFromURL** (*url: MFString*): Promise\<X3DScene\>

Parse the passed URL into an X3D scene and return a Promise that resolves to an X3DScene object.

#### **loadURL** (*url: MFString, parameter?: MFString*): Promise\<void\>

Load the passed URL, using the passed parameter string to possibly redirect it to another frame. If the destination is the frame containing the current scene, this method may never return. The return value is a Promise object, that is resolved when the new scene is loaded.

#### **importDocument** (*dom: HTMLElement | string*): Promise\<X3DScene\>

Imports an X3D XML DOM document or fragment, converts it, and returns a Promise that resolves to an X3DScene object.

#### **importJS** (*json: JSONObject | string*): Promise\<X3DScene\>

Imports an X3D JSON document or fragment, converts it, and returns a Promise that resolves to an X3DScene object.

#### **getBrowserProperty** (*name: string*): boolean

Returns a browser property with the corresponding *name*.

#### **changeViewpoint** (*[layerNode: SFNode,] name: string*): void

Changes the bound viewpoint node to the viewpoint named *name*. The viewpoint must be available in *layerNode*. If *layerNode* is omitted, the active layer is used.

#### **getClosestObject** (*[layerNode: SFNode,] direction: SFVec3d | SFVec3f*): { distance: number } <small><span class="blue">non-standard</span></small>

Returns the distance to the closest collidable object when looked in *direction* measured from the active viewpoint position. The maximum returned value is `avatarHeight * 2` (where *avatarHeight* is the second value of [NavigationInfo](/x_ite/components/navigation/navigationinfo/) *avatarSize*). Compare with *collisionRadius* (first value of [NavigationInfo](/x_ite/components/navigation/navigationinfo/) *avatarSize*) to detect if a collision with an object occurs. If *layerNode* is omitted, the active layer is used.

The return value is an object with currently a single property *distance*.

#### **beginUpdate** (): void

Start processing events.

#### **endUpdate** (): void

Stop processing events.

#### **print** (*... args: any []*): void

Prints *objects* to the browser's console without a newline character. Successive calls to this function append the descriptions on the same line. The output is the implicit call to the object's `toString ()` function.

#### **println** (*... args: any []*): void

Prints *objects* to the browser's console, inserting a newline character after the output. Successive calls to this function will result in each output presented on separate lines. The output is the implicit call to the object's `toString ()` function.

#### **dispose** (): void

Disposes this X3DBrowser. The object can then no longer be used.

### VRML Methods

To be downward compatible with VRML, the following additional functions are available:

#### **getName** (): string

A browser-implementation specific string describing the browser.

#### **getVersion** (): string

A browser-implementation specific string describing the browser version.

#### **getCurrentSpeed** (): number

The current speed of the avatar in m/s.

#### **getCurrentFrameRate** (): number

The current frame rate in frames per second.

#### **getWorldURL** (): string

A string containing the URL of this execution context.

#### **replaceWorld** (*nodes: MFNode*): void

Replace the current world with this new nodes that has been loaded or constructed from somewhere.

#### **createVrmlFromString** (*vrmlSyntax: string*): MFNode

The string may be any valid VRML content.

#### **createVrmlFromURL** (*url: MFString, node: SFNode, event: string*): void

Parse the passed URL into an VRML scene. When complete send the passed event to the passed node. The event is a string with the name of an MFNode inputOnly field of the passed node.

#### **addRoute** (*sourceNode: SFNode, sourceField: string, destinationNode: SFNode, destinationField: string*): void

Add a route from the passed *sourceField* to the passed *destinationField*.

#### **deleteRoute** (*sourceNode: SFNode, sourceField: string, destinationNode: SFNode, destinationField: string*): void

Remove the route between the passed *sourceField* and passed *destinationField*, if one exists.

#### **loadURL** (*url: MFString, parameter?: MFString*): void

Load the passed URL, using the passed parameter string to possibly redirect it to another frame. If the destination is the frame containing the current scene, this method may never return.

#### **setDescription** (*description: string*): void

A user-defined String.

## X3DConcreteNode

The X3DConcreteNode interface defines an interface for concrete node types, it extends the X3DAbstractNode interface. The object consists solely of read-only properties. It does not define any additional functions.

### Instance Creation Method(s)

None. This object cannot be instantiated by the user.

### Static Properties

#### **containerField**: string

The default container field name for this node. This property is read only.

#### **specificationRange**: { from: string, to: string }

Returns an object with two strings defining the first version and last version where this node is specified. This property is read only.

#### **fieldDefinitions**: FieldDefinitionArray

Returns a list of fields defined for the SFNode object.

## X3DAbstractNode

The X3DAbstractNode interface defines an interface for concrete node types. The object consists solely of read-only properties. It does not define any additional functions.

### Instance Creation Method(s)

None. This object cannot be instantiated by the user.

### Static Properties

#### **typeName**: string

The node type name for this class. This property is read only.

#### **componentInfo**: { name: string, level: number }

Returns an object with two properties *name* and *level* which can be used to get a ComponentInfo object from the X3D browser. This property is read only.

## ConcreteNodesArray

ConcreteNodesArray is an object that represents an array of classes derived from X3DNode. This is a read-only object. Individual elements of the array can be referenced using the standard C-style dereferencing operator (e.g. *concreteNodesArrayName*[*index*], where *index* is an integer-valued expression with 0\<=*index*\<length and length is the number of elements in the array).

### Instance Creation Method(s)

None. This object cannot be instantiated by the user.

### Properties

#### **length**: number

An integer containing the number of elements in the array. This property is read only.

### Methods

None

## AbstractNodesArray

AbstractNodesArray is an object that represents an array of classes derived from X3DNode. This is a read-only object. Individual elements of the array can be referenced using the standard C-style dereferencing operator (e.g. *abstractNodesArrayName*[*index*], where *index* is an integer-valued expression with 0\<=*index*\<length and length is the number of elements in the array).

### Instance Creation Method(s)

None. This object cannot be instantiated by the user.

### Properties

#### **length**: number

An integer containing the number of elements in the array. This property is read only.
