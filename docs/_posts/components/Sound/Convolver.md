## Overview

Convolver performs a linear convolution on a given AudioBuffer, often used to achieve a reverberation effect.

The Convolver node belongs to the **Sound** component and requires at least level **2,** its default container field is *children.* It is available from X3D version 4.0 or higher.

## Fields

### SFNode [in, out] **metadata** NULL <small>[X3DMetadataObject]</small>

Information about this node can be contained in a [MetadataBoolean](/x_ite/components/core/metadataboolean/), [MetadataDouble](/x_ite/components/core/metadatadouble/), [MetadataFloat](/x_ite/components/core/metadatafloat/), [MetadataInteger](/x_ite/components/core/metadatainteger/), [MetadataString](/x_ite/components/core/metadatastring/) or [MetadataSet](/x_ite/components/core/metadataset/) node.

#### Hint

- [X3D Architecture 7.2.4 Metadata](https://www.web3d.org/specifications/X3Dv4/ISO-IEC19775-1v4-IS//Part01/components/core.html#Metadata){:target="_blank"}

### SFString [in, out] **description** ""

Author-provided prose that describes intended purpose of the url asset.

#### Hint

- Many XML tools substitute XML character references for special characters automatically if needed within an attribute value (such as &amp;#38; for &amp; ampersand character, or &amp;#34; for " quotation-mark character).

### SFBool [in, out] **enabled** TRUE

Enables/disables node operation.

### SFInt32 [in, out] **numberOfChannels** 0 <small>[0,∞)</small>

Input/Output field *numberOfChannels*.

### MFFloat [in, out] **buffer** [ ] <small>[−1,1]</small>

*buffer* is a memory-resident audio asset that can contain one or more channels. *buffer* data format is non-interleaved 32-bit floating-point linear PCM values with a normal range of [−1,1], but values are not limited to this range.

#### Hint

- [Wikipedia Pulse-Code Modulation (PCM)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pulse-code_modulation){:target="_blank"}

### SFFloat [in, out] **gain** 1 <small>(-∞,∞)</small>

The *gain* field is a factor that represents the amount of linear amplification to apply to the output of the node.

#### Hint

- Negative *gain* factors negate the input signal.

#### Warning

- Decibel values shall not be used.

### SFTime [in, out] **tailTime** 0 <small>[0,∞)</small>

*tailTime* is duration of time that a node continues to provide output signal after the input signal becomes silent.

### SFBool [in, out] **normalize** FALSE

*normalize* controls whether or not the impulse response from the buffer is scaled by an equal-power normalization when the buffer field is set

### SFInt32 [in, out] **channelCount**

*channelCount* reports number of channels provided by input nodes.

#### Hint

- [W3C Web Audio API](https://www.w3.org/TR/webaudio/#dom-audionode-channelcount){:target="_blank"}

### SFString [in, out] **channelCountMode** "MAX" <small>["MAX", "CLAMPED-MAX", "EXPLICIT"]</small>

*channelCountMode* determines how individual channels are counted when up-mixing and down-mixing connections to any inputs.

#### Hint

- [W3C Web Audio API](https://www.w3.org/TR/webaudio/#dom-audionode-channelcountmode){:target="_blank"}

### SFString [in, out] **channelInterpretation** "SPEAKERS" <small>["SPEAKERS", "DISCRETE"]</small>

*channelInterpretation* determines how individual channels are treated when up-mixing and down-mixing connections to any inputs.

#### Hint

- [W3C Web Audio API](https://www.w3.org/TR/webaudio/#dom-audionode-channelinterpretation){:target="_blank"}

### SFTime [in, out] **startTime** 0 <small>(-∞,∞)</small>

Absolute time: number of seconds since January 1, 1970, 00:00:00 GMT.

#### Hint

- ROUTE a time value matching system clock to this field, such as output event from [TouchSensor](/x_ite/components/pointingdevicesensor/touchsensor/) touchTime or [TimeTrigger](/x_ite/components/eventutilities/timetrigger/) triggerTime.

### SFTime [in, out] **resumeTime** 0 <small>(-∞,∞)</small>

When *resumeTime* becomes \<= time now, isPaused becomes false and [AudioClip](/x_ite/components/sound/audioclip/) becomes active. Absolute time: number of seconds since January 1, 1970, 00:00:00 GMT.

#### Hint

- ROUTE a time value matching system clock to this field, such as output event from [TouchSensor](/x_ite/components/pointingdevicesensor/touchsensor/) touchTime or [TimeTrigger](/x_ite/components/eventutilities/timetrigger/) triggerTime.

### SFTime [in, out] **pauseTime** 0 <small>(-∞,∞)</small>

When time now \>= *pauseTime*, isPaused becomes true and [AudioClip](/x_ite/components/sound/audioclip/) becomes paused. Absolute time: number of seconds since January 1, 1970, 00:00:00 GMT.

#### Hint

- ROUTE a time value matching system clock to this field, such as output event from [TouchSensor](/x_ite/components/pointingdevicesensor/touchsensor/) touchTime or [TimeTrigger](/x_ite/components/eventutilities/timetrigger/) triggerTime.

### SFTime [in, out] **stopTime** 0 <small>(-∞,∞)</small>

Absolute time: number of seconds since January 1, 1970, 00:00:00 GMT.

#### Hint

- ROUTE a time value matching system clock to this field, such as output event from [TouchSensor](/x_ite/components/pointingdevicesensor/touchsensor/) touchTime or [TimeTrigger](/x_ite/components/eventutilities/timetrigger/) triggerTime.

#### Warnings

- An active [TimeSensor](/x_ite/components/time/timesensor/) node ignores set_cycleInterval and set_startTime events.
- An active [TimeSensor](/x_ite/components/time/timesensor/) node ignores set_stopTime event values less than or equal to startTime.

### SFBool [out] **isPaused**

*isPaused* true/false events are sent when [AudioClip](/x_ite/components/sound/audioclip/) is paused/resumed.

#### Warning

- It is an error to define this transient outputOnly field in an X3D file, instead only use it a source for ROUTE events.

### SFBool [out] **isActive**

*isActive* true/false events are sent when playback starts/stops.

#### Warning

- It is an error to define this transient outputOnly field in an X3D file, instead only use it a source for ROUTE events.

### SFTime [out] **elapsedTime**

Current elapsed time since [AudioClip](/x_ite/components/sound/audioclip/) activated/running, cumulative in seconds, and not counting any paused time.

#### Hint

- *elapsedTime* is a nonnegative SFTime duration interval, not an absolute clock time.

#### Warning

- It is an error to define this transient outputOnly field in an X3D file, instead only use it a source for ROUTE events.

### MFNode [in, out] **children** [ ] <small>[X3DSoundChannelNode,X3DSoundProcessingNode,X3DSoundSourceNode]</small>

The *children* field specifies audio-graph sound sources providing input signals for this node. If multiple input signals are provided by the inputs *children* field, all channels are mixed together and merged prior to presentation.

#### Hint

- Can be original (DEF) or referenced (USE) nodes.

#### Warning

- Contained [AudioClip](/x_ite/components/sound/audioclip/) or [MovieTexture](/x_ite/components/texturing/movietexture/) nodes must have `containerField='children'` to override otherwise-incorrect defaults.

## Advice

### Hints

- Potential modifications include chorus effects, reverberation, and telephone-like speech.
