## Overview

Material specifies surface rendering properties for associated geometry nodes. Material attributes are used by the X3D lighting equations during rendering.

The Material node belongs to the **Shape** component and requires at least level **1,** its default container field is *material.* It is available since VRML 2.0 and from X3D version 3.0 or higher.

- *transparency* \< .5 opaque, *transparency* \> .5 transparent.

## Advice

### Hints

- Insert [Shape](/x_ite/components/shape/shape/) and [Appearance](/x_ite/components/shape/appearance/) nodes before adding material.
- DEF/USE copies of a single node can provide a similar "look + feel" style for related shapes in a scene.
