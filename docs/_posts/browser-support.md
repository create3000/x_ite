{: .prompt-info .clear }

We do not support older browsers like Internet Explorer 6-9, Opera 12.1x or Safari 5.1+.

## Unsupported Browsers

While X_ITE *might* run without major issues in older browser versions, we do not actively test X_ITE in them and generally do not fix bugs that may appear in them.

Similarly, X_ITE does not fix bugs in pre-release versions of browsers, such as beta or dev releases. If you find a bug with X_ITE in a pre-release of a browser, you should report the bug to the browser vendor.

## About Browser Support

X_ITE is constantly tested with all of its supported browsers via unit tests. However, a web page using X_ITE may not work in the same set of browsers if its own code takes advantage of (or falls prey to) browser-specific behaviors. Testing is essential to fully support a browser. The Microsoft Edge Developer site makes available [virtual machines](https://dev.windows.com/en-us/microsoft-edge/tools/vms/) for testing many different versions of Internet Explorer. Older versions of other browsers can be found at [oldversion.com](http://oldversion.com/).

Only the most current version of X_ITE is tested and updated to fix bugs or add features. Users of older versions that find a bug should upgrade to the latest released version to determine if the bug has already been fixed.
