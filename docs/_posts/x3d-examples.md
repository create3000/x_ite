**Generating a Keyboard with JavaScript and Prototypes**

In X3D, a virtual keyboard can be dynamically created by defining reusable key shapes as `ProtoDeclare` and instancing them with `ProtoInstance`. JavaScript scripts within the X3D scene can generate and arrange these prototypes programmatically, enabling interactive keyboard layouts.
