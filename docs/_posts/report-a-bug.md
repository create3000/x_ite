If you run into any bugs or encounter any other abnormal issues with X_ITE, let us know!

Here's an example of a helpful bug report:

>*I fell through a hole on the Resistance map. I was running along the wall near the pool of water and fell through a black hole in the wall. I got stuck and had to leave the match. This happened while playing Search and Destroy.*
{: .prompt-danger }

Even if you just want to ask a question, you've come to the right place. You can also use the Issue Tracker if you have a question or if you need help with something.

Go ahead and visit the [X_ITE Issue Tracker](https://github.com/create3000/x_ite/issues){:target="_blank"} to post your concern.
